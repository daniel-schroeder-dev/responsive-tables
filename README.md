# Responsive Table

Grid cells representing table data will adjust responsively and dynamically change the layout of the grid but still match the original data relationships.

## Question

I have a problem because I want to have a responsive table

I have this table example and I want to have a different layout when a min screen is reached.

---------------------------------------------
column1 column2 column2
---------------------------------------------
data 1. data2. data3
data 1. data2. data3
data 1. data2. data3

---------------------------------------------

I want to have the cells in stack rather than in a row, but I also want to have the column header before the data of the cells.  like this:

-----------------------
column1: data 1
column2. data 2
column3. data 3
-------------------------
column1: data 1
column2. data 2
column3. data 3
-------------------------
column1: data 1
column2. data 2
column3. data 3
--------------------------
